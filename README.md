# Automated Neural Network

Nowadays, machine learning techniques and algorithms are
employed in almost every application domain (e.g., financial
applications, advertising, recommendation systems, user behavior analytics). In practice, they are playing a crucial role
in harnessing the power of massive amounts of data which
we are currently producing every day in our digital world. In
general, the process of building a high-quality machine learning model is an iterative, complex and time-consuming process that involves trying different algorithms and techniques
in addition to having a good experience with effectively tuning their hyper-parameters. In particular, conducting this
process efficiently requires solid knowledge and experience
with the various techniques that can be employed. With the
continuous and vast increase of the amount of data in our
digital world, it has been acknowledged that the number of
knowledgeable data scientists can not scale to address these
challenges. Thus, there was a crucial need for automating
the process of building good machine learning models. In the
last few years, several techniques and frameworks have been
introduced to tackle the challenge of automating the process of Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter
tuning (CASH) in the machine learning domain. The main
aim of these techniques is to reduce the role of human in the
loop and fill the gap for non-expert machine learning users
by playing the role of the domain expert.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
npm install 

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
npm test 
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
